☕- 👋 Hi, I’m Denis, currently located in NYC.
- 👀 Currently working with React and TypeScript, but also learning some C, .NET, DS and alghoritms.
- 🌲 I enjoy running and long hikes, reading books and chilling with my 3 cats.
- 🍺 I’m currently learning, well, more about JS, React and TS. We all know that learning never stops. I’m looking to connect with people who share similar interests, feel free to ping me in case you wanna chat and/or get a cup of coffee/beer.
