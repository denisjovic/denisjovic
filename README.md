- 👋 Hi, I’m Denis, currently located in NYC.
- 👀 I’m working with React and TypeScript and my goal is to become a great developer and use my skills to help people and improve stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well, more about JS, React and TS. We all know that learning never stops.
- 💞️ I’m looking to connect with people who share similar interests, feel free to ping me in case you wanna chat and/or get a cup of coffee (beer).
